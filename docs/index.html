			<div class="block_content">
				<div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/mobilehealth_thumb.png" /></div>
				<div class="block_description">
					<span>Unreal Engine from Epic Games is a massively popular game development framework that has provided the foundation to build some of the most popular video games in recent memory. The platform has made it easy for game studios to create rich, in-depth games that meet gamers’ increasing demands for out-of-this-world experiences without interruption. But crashes can still occur, and errors left unresolved can affect user retention and, ultimately, revenue loss. How can developers not only solve, but learn from these errors to prevent similar crashes in the future?<br/><br/>
					Join us as we invite Ari Arnbjörnsson, Unreal Engine Evangelist at Epic Games, for a fireside chat with Bugsnag to discuss implementing, measuring, and improving mobile game health and performance.  </span>
